## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm febrifahmi
<img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=febrifahmi" alt="febrifahmi">

- ðŸ”­  In the meantime I ~~currently working on~~ think I have to put a side one of my project, [Rippleet](https://www.rippleet.com), while it's being part of 1000startupdigital program batch 2020 but I only finished a figma mockup back then..), recently I'm playing with very simple flask app [ArkonsElevate](https://arkonselevate.com) as part of my "gamification" edu research, and now try to develop my new Remix app SimProcu ..
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning React/React Native, Flask, and now **Remix** (yeay!)
- ðŸ¤”  as someone with architecture educational background, it's hard for me to enter the so called housing development bussiness (mainly because it needs a lot of resources, including solid funding, to be able to do that).. yes, and the web development path has lower _barrier to entry_ for people like me.. so here I am..
- âš¡ Fun fact: student of intensive coding bootcamp which only cost me 200K IDR for a month of intensive online training (I've spent only 400K IDR to learn Laravel and React Native) but yeah, you still have to learn a lot more.. but the most valuable for me is the one provided for free by Miguel Grinberg in his **Full Flask Mega Tutorial** (check it out, it's awesome piece of work!)
- Now mostly active on [github's sibling](https://gitlab.com)..
